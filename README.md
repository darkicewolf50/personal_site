#rust #dioxus

This is the code that runs my WASM site. It currently uses dioxus 0.6 and eagerly awaiting for diouxs 0.7 as it looks to be a great update.

This is a mirror of the repo, live code is hosted [here](https://gitea.bajacloud.duckdns.org/darkicewolf50/personal_site) as well as any testing of the code.

I do not consent for this code to be used in any training data for AI or AI like products or services.

This is only uploaded here so that I can bet those sweet sweet green marks on my gituhb profile.
