                                <h1>About</h1>
                                <p>I'm a third year Software Engineer Student at University of Calgary. I am learning the language of how to design, develop, and create programs that are to industry standards and reasonably efficent. I bring the lessons learned from each project I have completed, learning from the mistakes I have made and bringing corrected versions forward into the next project.</p>
                                <p>As of writing this I intend to bring the knowledge learned from my time at university in Software Engineering onto a Baja SAE car, where we can collect data remotely and graph data for instantaneous and future analysis, during vechile operation.</p>
                                <p>I grew up in a small ski town where, I started learning about programming, from of course Minecraft, where I thought the application of this was so futuristic and downright cool that I knew I wanted to persure it further. While living there I spend a majority of my time outside of school swimming competitively, where I ranked top 10 in BC. Along with swimming I spend a lot of time volunteering with fundraising events and coaching the local Special Olympics swim team.</p>
