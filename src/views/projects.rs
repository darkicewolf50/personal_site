            This minor update added functionality for the contact me, the ground work for the blogs part of the site, as well as many minor 
            UI consistencies to ensure that all of the buttons and links felt like buttons and links.
            I was surprise how easy it was to set up a discord webhook using the 'reqwest' crate. 
            As I continue on I find myself struggling with how and why to use databases for content I generate. 
            I think using tools like disocrd webhooks and email notifications are great for users but certainly not great for reading data from. 
            The part I am both excited for and deading is going to be the blogs component which I believe I have solved for now.",

                It was certainly interesting to go through all of the stages of front end web developement, while the orignal and new found scope is not currently achieved, it will be on a later pass through.
                I am very happy with how it turned out in compairison to my origanl site map, and wireframes.

                Using automated uploads and linting to check the Python and FastAPI code was excellent for learning how to self-host a web server.
                This was then upgraded later with the addition of treafik so that it could be SSL certified, this is also known as supporting HTTPS transmissions.
                Ultimately it will serve as a great stepping stone for both myself an anyone else in UCalgary Baja Software subteam.

                This isn't to say that it is faster or have additional perks of using 'non-code website builders'. 
                This is provided massive opportunities to learn teach and save on cost compaired to the website builders. 
                Overall I would say this will be worth it in the long run and opened my eyes to different website hosting providers,
